This project could be called differently: "My first REST API". Yes, exactly from this project my passion for the Java language began, I started learn the Springboot framework and work with web programming. This project is a good indicator of using basic OOP concepts, working with http requests and testing the application.

 ## Main task

Creating a REST API to manage discount codes for sales or promotions, integrating with an in-memory database for efficient data handling.

 ## What I learned

 Create REST API, test API with Postman, work with Spring Framework, database management, schema management, work with in memory database 

 ## How I tested my App
