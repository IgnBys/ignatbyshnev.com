## Storyline

The main goal of the game is to repair the damaged ship by finding and collecting all the missing items. The items have been scattered across the planetary system with a dense asteroid belt, so finding all the items can be a challenge. During the game, the player will explore space in search of the necessary parts and tools. Each found item brings the player closer to achieving the main goal - restoring the ship's efficiency and functionality. The planets vary in texture and size. Some are slightly larger stones, while others are planets with moons and thick clouds.

## Implemented computer graphics methods

- Normal Mapping - depth effect on the surface of objects
- PBR - realistic lighting of different types of surfaces
- Noise - animated effect of lava (on the sun) and clouds (on some planets)
- Tone Mapping - normalization of color subjected to strong lighting
- SkyBox - game background
