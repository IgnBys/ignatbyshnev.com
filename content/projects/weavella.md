## About

https://weavella.mooo.com/

I present to your attention my pride, into which a lot of effort and time was invested - a virtual fitting room. The purpose of this application is to allow you to try on clothes online.

Weavella is a group project that was done to complete my undergraduate studies. The application is written using **Java** and **Python** on the backend, **React** on the frontend, using **Firestore** as a database and **Kafka** for microservice communication.

## My tasks

Each member of the team has made a huge contribution to the creation of this application, but you, my dear guest, are probably interested in my merits.

 - Building a RESTful API with Spring Boot

 - Managing NoSQL Firestore database

 - Integrating Kafka for microservices communication

 - Writing unit tests using JUnit

 - Implementing API tests in Bruno

 - Ensuring CI\CD Pipelines

 - Project management using Jira and Bitbucket

 - Implementing image processing algorithms using OpenCV.

 - Integrating AI pose estimation and object recognition with MediaPipe

 ## UX/UI

The application has a nice and intuitive design. Although the main functions are already in the application - it is at the initial stage of development and will be supplemented with new functions in the next versions.

## Adding clothes to wardrobe

Imagine you are browsing clothes in one of the online stores, and suddenly you find something that you really like. First, you have to order the item through the online store, wait for delivery, pay extra for delivery and, perhaps, if you donâ€™t like how the item looks on you after trying it on, return the purchased item. The Weavella app allows you to add the item you like to your wardrobe in real time.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="/liked_clothes.jpg" alt="Liked clothes" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="/optimizing_image.jpg" alt="Optimizing clothes" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="/segmented_clothes.jpg" alt="Segmented clothes" style="width: 45%;">
</div>

## Fitting result

After successful segmentation and adding clothes to the wardrobe, this item of clothing can be tried on your own model. The application boasts a fairly good quality of trying on clothes on a model you have prepared in advance.

    <img src="/with_clothes.jpg" alt="Model with clothes" style="width: 45%;">
</div>
