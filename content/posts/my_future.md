This week I am participating in the "Career View" competition held by Adam Mickiewicz University. The competition's main goal is to show the visibility of your future work. In this concept, I tried to show the difference between a beginner student, who spends most of his time studying, without having large resources for equipment and having basic knowledge in his field - and a professional programmer with a full package of conveniences and comfort for work.
P.S. I intend to become that imaginary person in my head :)
