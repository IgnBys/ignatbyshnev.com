      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I am participating in the &amp;ldquo;Career View&amp;rdquo; competition held by Adam Mickiewicz University. The competition&amp;rsquo;s main goal is to show the visibility of your future work. In this concept, I tried to show the difference between a beginner student, who spends most of his time studying, without having large resources for equipment and having basic knowledge in his field - and a professional programmer with a full package of conveniences and comfort for work.
P.S. I intend to become that imaginary person in my head :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
